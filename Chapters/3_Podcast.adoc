== Chapter 3: Automating Podcast-to-Social Content Pipeline (45 pages)

_From 2-Hour Episodes to 50+ Platform-Optimized Clips_

=== Business Problem Setup (2 pages)

*The Challenge:* Marketing teams spend 40+ hours manually creating
social media content from each podcast episode - transcribing, finding
key moments, creating clips, adding captions, and optimizing for
different platforms. This bottleneck prevents consistent social presence
and limits content reach.

*The Solution:* Build an automated pipeline that processes 2-hour
podcast recordings and outputs 50+ social media clips optimized for
TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and LinkedIn - reducing 40 hours of
work to 2 hours of review.

*Success Metrics:* - Process 120-minute podcast → 50+ clips in under 3
hours - 90%+ automated content approval rate - 5x increase in social
content volume - 80% reduction in content creation costs
